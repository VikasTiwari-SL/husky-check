 // many functions will come for modifying input here..some will be here and some will go
  // to dropdown

  // cant maintain a separate custom input too much callback props

  // some functions will only modify the dropdown...make a separate hook

  // q. how dropdown can be fleible in types if the filters change ? only way i see
  //     is to incorporate all the types we are going to use in the projects

  //  maintaining the current key-value for searchParams through useMemo..a spimple logc
  //  so must run at each render
